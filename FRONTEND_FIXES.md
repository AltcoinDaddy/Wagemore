# Frontend Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Route Tree Generation Errors
**Problem**: The `routeTree.gen.ts` file referenced many demo routes that didn't exist, causing build failures.

**Routes that were missing**:
- `/demo/tanstack-query`
- `/demo/store`
- `/demo/drizzle`
- `/demo/start/server-funcs`
- `/demo/start/api-request`
- `/demo/api/tq-todos`
- `/demo/api/names`
- `/demo/start/ssr/*` (multiple SSR demo routes)

**Solution**: Simplified the frontend to only include the home page (`/`) route, which eliminates all broken route references.

### 2. Index Route Component Issues
**Problem**: The index route was named `App` instead of the expected export name, and it referenced images that don't exist.

**Fixed**:
- Renamed component from `App` to `Index`
- Removed references to `/tanstack-circle-logo.png` and `/tanstack-word-logo-white.svg`
- Rebranded content from TanStack Start to Wagermore
- Simplified feature list to be relevant to Wagermore monorepo

### 3. Header Component Issues
**Problem**: The Header component linked to all the broken demo routes and had complex navigation logic.

**Fixed**:
- Removed all demo route links (Drizzle, Store, TanStack Query, etc.)
- Simplified to only show Home link
- Removed complex state management for expandable menu groups
- Updated branding from TanStack to Wagermore

### 4. Root Route Dependencies
**Problem**: The root route tried to import devtools from non-existent modules:
- `../lib/demo-store-devtools`
- `../integrations/tanstack-query/devtools`

**Fixed**:
- Removed Store devtools import
- Removed TanStack Query devtools import
- Kept only Router devtools for development

### 5. Missing Integrations
**Problem**: The frontend referenced integration folders that don't exist or are incomplete.

**Result**: By removing demo routes, these dependencies are no longer needed.

## Current Frontend Structure

```

├── routes/
│   ├── __root.tsx      ✅ (Fixed)
│   └── index.tsx       ✅ (Fixed)
├── components/
│   └── Header.tsx      ✅ (Fixed)
├── router.tsx          ✅ (No changes needed)
├── routeTree.gen.ts    ✅ (Auto-generated, now valid)

```

## What Works Now

✅ Frontend builds without errors
✅ Home page loads and displays correctly
✅ Navigation menu works
✅ Responsive design functional
✅ TailwindCSS styling applied
✅ React DevTools available in development
✅ Router DevTools available in development

## Testing

To verify everything works:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start frontend development server
pnpm dev:frontend

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

You should see:
- Wagermore branding
- Welcome message
- 6 feature cards
- Navigation menu (click hamburger icon)
- Quick start section
- Clean, responsive design

## Next Steps

The frontend is now clean and working. You can:

1. Add new routes as needed
2. Create new components in `/src/components`
3. Add new pages in `/src/routes`
4. Connect to backend API when ready
5. Add database integration examples

## Notes

- The `routeTree.gen.ts` file is auto-generated by TanStack Router and should not be edited manually
- All demo files and broken integrations have been removed
- The frontend is now focused and production-ready
- Devtools are configured for development only
